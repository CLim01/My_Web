    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p><strong><a href="https://www.w3.org" target="_blank" title="W3C">
    The HyperText Markup Language</a>, or <u>HTML</u> is the standard markup language
    for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.</strong> It can be assisted
    by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages
    such as JavaScript.</p>

    <p style ="margin-top: 40px">Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage
    and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the
    structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the
    appearance of the document.</p>

    <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs,
    images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the
    rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by
    denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists,
    links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written
    using angle brackets.</p>
