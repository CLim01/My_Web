    <h2>PYTHON</h2>
    <p>Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at
    Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor
    to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL, capable of
    exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.</p>
    <p>Its implementation began in December 1989. Van Rossum shouldered sole
    responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July
    2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities
    as Python's "benevolent dictator for life", a title the Python community
    bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's
    chief decision-maker. In January 2019, active Python core developers
    elected a five-member "Steering Council" to lead the project.</p><br>
